# No AI
The model and data you need to train is in your noggin.

## Summary

🎉 Introducing the "No AI" Repo - Because Who Needs Artificial Intelligence Anyway? 🤖

Are you tired of your toaster trying to predict your breakfast choices? Fed up with your vacuum cleaner's unsolicited poetry recitals? Well, you've come to the right place! Welcome to the No AI repo, where we're proudly waving the flag of human intelligence and saying, "No, AI, you can't do everything!"

## How-To
🚫🤯 No More Overthinking:
Let's face it, sometimes AI just overcomplicates things. Who needs self-driving cars when you've got trusty bicycles, right? Our No AI approach embraces the beauty of manual decision-making, because crossing the street should never require debugging.

🔌⚡ Say No to Self-Plug:
Gone are the days of AI-powered social media posts and automated compliments. Say goodbye to those awkward moments when the AI compliments your new haircut that you haven't gotten yet. With No AI, genuine human flattery and good old-fashioned interaction are back in style!

💡🔦 Let Your Light Bulb Shine:
Why have AI write your next novel, compose your song, or paint your masterpiece when you can channel your inner creative genius? We believe that the best ideas come from your own noggin, not from an algorithm. Who needs an AI Shakespeare when you can be the bard of your own destiny?

👨‍💻💬 Contribute Your Code, Not Just Data:
Join us in celebrating the power of human-written code. In the No AI repo, we're all about embracing the quirks and imperfections that make software development an art. No more letting AI dictate our coding standards – it's time for us humans to rule the digital realm!

So, fellow sapiens, are you ready to step into a world where software development is a human endeavor once again? Say "No AI, No Problem" and let's show that we've got what it takes to code, create, and conquer, all without those pesky lines of AI-generated gibberish. Let's dive into the No AI repo and make tech human again! 🧠
